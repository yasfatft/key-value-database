# Key-Value Database
- By default, it is designed to work in Linux because of various path structures in windows (or Mac), but it can run easily on Windows and Mac too, with just a few editions. 

- You only need to change variables named ```data_files_path``` and ```data_files_name``` at the beginning of ```db.py``` according to your operating system.
- For the database structure to be easy to work with I suggest defining all keys and also values 8-chars long. This feature help saving and loading data from file fast, easy and understandable.
