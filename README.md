# key_value_database
here is a key-value database implementation in python language programming by myself.
- by default it is designed to work in linux because of diffrent path structure in windows(or Mac) and linux , but it can run easily on windows and Mac too. you only need to change variables naemd Data_files_path and data_files_name at the begining of the key_value_database.py file according to your operating system.
- for the database structure to be easy to work with i prefer to define all keys and also values 8 char long. this feature help saving and loading data from file fast and easy and understandable.
